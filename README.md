# PROJECT IS INACTIVE

# Prototype of a Zi Dashboard based solely on Angular

To install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) needs to be installed on the system.

If this is the case, the Dashboard can be tested with the following commands from the root directory.

`cd Dashboard`

First launch only: 

`npm install`

`ng serve`

Build for github-pages

`ng build --prod --base-href "/cov19vaccsim/"`
`cp ../docs/index.html ../docs/404.html`

The angular.json assumes that doc is the desired output dir.

# Notes

- To allow proper Routing on github pages, index.html as generated by ng build needs to be placed inside the docs folder. And protected from latzer deletion via `.gitignore` file.
